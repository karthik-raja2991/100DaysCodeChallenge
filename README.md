# Following Problems are solved as part of 100 Days code challenge

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Problem 1:-** You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

**Example:**

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Problem 2:-** Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.
 
**Example:**
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Problem 3:-**Given a 1-indexed array of integers numbers that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number. Let these two numbers be numbers[index1] and numbers[index2] where 1 <= index1 < index2 <= numbers.length

**Example:**
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
